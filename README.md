# UvA Advanced Econometrics 1 - 1st assignment
In this assignment we had to simulate ordinary two stage least squares model and evaluate power of Hausman test. 
This was done using monte carlo, where we have specified several variance - covariance matrices.
Even though MatLab is used for econometrics here, I and my partner Štěpán decided to use Python. 
Next time I would rather use R as I feel it is better fit for such assignments.
